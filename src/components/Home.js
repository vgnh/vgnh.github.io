          Hi there! I'm Vignesh.
          <br /><br />
          I'm a developer who currently works with web technologies such as HTML/CSS/JavaScript, Node.js (Express) and React.
          Other technologies I've worked with in the past include Java, Kotlin, C#, and a bit of Python.
          I enjoy working with open source software, learning new technologies and languages.
          <br /><br />
          I'm fairly new to the web stack and I'm still learning the design principles.<br />
          While this may be the case, this is the stack I've chosen to become proficient at as of now.<br />
          I have varied interests when it comes to software, and in my free time you can often find me reading/learning about things
          such as retro game programming books, IoT, retro console emulators, etc. My current interests include learning and becoming proficient at a
          systems programming language such as Rust and learning about WebAssembly.
          <br /><br />
          My other unrelated interests include learning to read and speak 日本語, which I must say is currently on pause.<br />
          I'm also a huge <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gundam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Gundam</a> nerd and I'd even attribute it to laying the foundation for my interest in Computer Science back when I was a little kid.
          <br /><br />
